# Alura #ImersaoGameDev

## Project
The project is a Endless Run Game developed in Javascript.
 
To develop this project we used the P5.js library and Alura assets such as Image and Sounds.

The goal of this project is to leard how to develop games using the same concept of the classical game develop, as Sonic, Mario, Space Invaders, Doom, Quake, Street Figther and other great classical games.

Of course the machine resources and technology has evolved a lot in the game world, so this game will be kept simple for now to explore the concept of basic game creation.

## Script
Alura called the main character "Bruxa Hipsta" - Hipster Witch - and chalange to create a Script to why she is running in the forest and what she is looking for.

To start I don't want to call her like that. I want to call her **Luna**, simple, clean and multilingue.

Why and What?
- Comming soon.

* Felipe Oliveira dos Santos:

I am a Web Developer living and working in Winnipeg/MB - Canada. Born and raised in Brazil and moved to Canada at the end of 2018 when a job opportunity was presented.

I enjoy expanding my knowledge and since I never have developed a game before decided to study this from the basics.
